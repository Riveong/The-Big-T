# The idea  
- We learn by interacting with our environment that's probably the first comes to our mind when we think about "nature learning".  
- When an infant (baby / child) learn to play, wave their hands, say their first word. They have no explicit teacher, Rather they are learning from their environment.
### Reinforcement Learning?
- Reinforcement learning is learning what to do. How to make situations to actions so as to maximize a numerical reward signal.  
- The learner must discover which actions yield the most rewards by trying them.  
- in some cases actions not only affect the immediate reward but also the next situation and through that, all subsequent rewards.
- The most distinguishing features of reinforcement learning: Trial and error search and delayerd reward.  
- Reinforcement learning is different from supervised learning. Supervised learning is learning from a training set of labeled examples provided by a knowledgable external supervisor. While reinforcement learning the agent is learning from its experience
- Reinforcement learning is also different from unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning: finding hidden labels in datas. Reinforcement learning is similar but not the same, Instead of finding the hidden structure, Reinforcement learning is maximize reward signal instead.(24)
